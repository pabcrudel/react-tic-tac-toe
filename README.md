Tic Tac Toe web game using Vite + React following the instructions of
[Midudev](https://github.com/midudev/aprendiendo-react/tree/master/projects/02-tic-tac-toe)

## The reason behind this project

When I was doing the project [TDD with
Vitest](https://github.com/pabcrudel/vitest-driven-development) following the
tutorial of Midudev, I realized that React is so interesting. I'm confident with
Vue so a lot of things of React where familiar to me. I decide to study in more
detail this framework taking a look to another [React
Tutorial 2:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkzcjwnueLA) by him.
