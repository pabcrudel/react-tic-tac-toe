# React Tic Tac Toe

Tic Tac Toe web game using Vite + React

## The reason behind this project

When I was doing the project [TDD with
Vitest](https://github.com/pabcrudel/vitest-driven-development) inspired in the
tutorial of Midudev, I realized that React is so interesting. I'm confident with
Vue so a lot of things of React where familiar to me. I decide to study in more
detail this framework taking a look to another Crash Course of React by Midudev:

- [YouTube tutorial (2:06:15)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkzcjwnueLA)

- [GitHub Repository: "Aprendiendo React"](https://github.com/midudev/aprendiendo-react/tree/master/projects/02-tic-tac-toe)
